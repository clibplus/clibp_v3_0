Note: The only confirmed working architecture is x86 and x86_64. Mainly on intel CPU!

### Supported Compilers

- GCC
- TCC
- CLANG

You can install with different compilers by doing

```bash
sudo make COMPILER=<compiler>
```

### Install

Run the following commands to install the library!
```bash
sudo apt install git make -y
git clone https://github.com/FlatStdlib/Stdlib.git	# FSL-Stdlib
git clone https://github.com/FlatStdlib/fsl.git 	# FSL-GCC Toolchain
cd Stdlib

# Sets global lib, loader and compiler!
# 64 Bit Compilation
sudo make 

# 32 Bit Compilation
sudo make DEBUG="-ggdb -m32 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-stack-protector" LDFLAGS="-m elf_i386"
```

# New Install

This installation is still being developed
